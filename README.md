Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications.\
It operates on a publish-subscribe model, where producers send records to topics, which are then consumed by subscribers. \
Kafka's architecture is built for high throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability, making it ideal for handling large volumes of data across distributed systems. \
It's commonly used for message queuing, activity tracking, log aggregation, and stream processing. \
Kafka's ability to persistently store and replicate data across multiple servers ensures durability and reliability, while its low-latency performance allows it to process millions of messages per second. \
This makes Kafka a powerful tool for organizations dealing with real-time data streams and complex event processing.\
